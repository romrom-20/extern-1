# Voter Eligibility Checker

This is a simple Python program created by saman to check if a user is eligible to vote based on their age.

## How to Run

Run the `voter_eligibility.py` script and enter your age when prompted. The program will tell you if you are eligible to vote or how many years you have to wait.

## Example

```
How old are you? 16
Oops! Youâ€™re not eligible yet. But hey, only 2 more years to go! ðŸ˜Š
```

```
How old are you? 20
Congratulations! You are eligible to vote. Go make a difference! ðŸŽ‰
