# Python Collections Assignment

This project contains solutions to the Python collections assignment by saman. It includes three tasks:

1. Working with lists (append, remove, reverse print)
2. Exploring dictionaries (add key-value, update, print keys and values)
3. Using tuples (create, attempt change, print length)

## How to Run

Run the `collections_assignment.py` script to see the output of each task.
