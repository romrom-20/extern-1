# Number Guessing Game

This project contains a simple and fun number guessing game created by saman.

## How to Play

Run the `guessing_game.py` script. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100. You have 10 attempts to guess the number.

After each guess, you will receive feedback:
- "Too high! Try again."
- "Too low! Try again."
- "Congratulations! You guessed it!" if you guess correctly.

If you fail to guess within 10 attempts, the game ends with a "Game over!" message.

Enjoy and have fun! ðŸ˜Š
